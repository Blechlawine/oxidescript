# Rustscript

Rust-like syntax compiling to javascript or typescript (the choice is not yet made).

## Why?

No, seriously. Rust has some great syntax, but in my opinion it's not ready for the web frontend. So why don't we just compile Rust to javascript?

## How?

Take a look at the syntax ideas: [Syntax](syntax.md)
